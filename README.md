# Tweeter Project
This is a front-end (client-side) project that aims to create a simple, single-page Twitter-like application called "Tweeter." The project is designed to enhance your skills in building a client-side web application that communicates with a server via AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML). Although you will review the project's back-end (server-side) code, you are not required to make edits to it.

# Project Description
The goal of this project is to create a functional and visually appealing Single Page App (SPA) that closely resembles Twitter's basic features
